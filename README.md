The Final Demo is hosted on Open Shift http://moodle-playlyfe.rhcloud.com/

If you would like to just install the final product then just clone the master repo like this,
`git clone https://github.com/pyros2097/moodle-integration.git`
and use this folder as your moodle src path in setting up [Docker Moodle](https://github.com/playlyfe/docker-moodle).

If you would also like to setup the initial database with admin user and all plugins installed then just do
```bash
playlyfer-4:~‚ù≠ sudo docker-enter moodle
root@2632e78200c2:/# mysql moodle < /path/to/clone/moodle.sql
```
